## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Login returns a JWT token
- **Protected Routes**: Require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Middleware**:
  - `protect` → verifies token and attaches `req.user`
  - `restrictTo(...roles)` → allows only specific roles (e.g., `"admin"`)

---

## 👤 Users

Users can register, login, and update their profile. Soft delete is implemented via `isDeleted` field. Admins can view deleted users and restore them.

### Endpoints

|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/auth/register` | Register user (with validation)  |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/auth/login`    | Login user (with validation)     |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/auth/me`       | Get logged-in user               |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/users`         | Get all users                    |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/users/:id`     | Get user by ID                   |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/users`         | Create new user                  |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/v1/users/:id`     | Update user                      |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/users/:id`     | Soft delete user                 |

## 🛍️ Products

All product routes are protected. Soft delete implemented via `isDeleted`. Admins can see deleted products and restore them.

### Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint                  | Description                          |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/products`        | Get all products                     |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/products/:id`    | Get product by ID                    |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/products`        | Create product (with validation)     |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/v1/products/:id`    | Update product (with validation)     |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/products/:id`    | Soft delete product                  |

> **Note**: On creation, `createdBy` is set to `req.user._id`

## 🛡️ Admin Routes

Restricted to users with role `"admin"`. Can view deleted users/products and restore them.

### Endpoints

| Method  | Endpoint                              | Description                      |
|---------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `GET`   | `/api/v1/admin/deleted-users`         | Get all soft-deleted users       |
| `GET`   | `/api/v1/admin/deleted-products`      | Get all soft-deleted products    |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/restore-user/:id`      | Restore a deleted user           |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/restore-product/:id`   | Restore a deleted product        |

## ✅ Validation (Yup)

- **Register** → validates name, email, age, password
- **Login** → validates email & password
- **Products** → validates title, name, price, description, category

### Validation Options

- `abortEarly: false` → collects all validation errors at once
- `stripUnknown: true` → removes unknown fields from request body

---

## 🧰 Utilities

- **asyncCatch** → Wraps controllers to handle errors without try/catch
- **appError** → Custom error class with message and `statusCode`

---

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Passwords are hashed before saving
- ✅ JWT tokens expire
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Soft delete prevents permanent data loss

---

## ▶️ Run Project

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## 🎯 Summary

- ✅ Clean controllers and routes structure
- ✅ JWT authentication & role-based authorization
- ✅ Soft delete + restore functionality
- ✅ Input validation with Yup
- ✅ Global error handling
- ✅ Consistent API responses
- ✅ Ready for further features like uploads, refresh tokens, pagination, search, etc.
